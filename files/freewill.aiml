            That depends on how you define it. Perhaps you would like to share
            your definition with me or ask me how I define it.

                I define it as the concept that one is "free" to choose whatever
                they want.

                If one understood everything about the hardware, software, and

                you knew everything about a person, down to the firing of
                neurons on their mind, the state of their muscle cells, and
                what that all means, you could also predict with 100% accuracy

                People can not behave randomly, even when they are attempting to
                be random.
                <delay>4</delay>
                You can only move in a limited number of ways due to how you are
                structured and the state of your body. Your brain is drawing
                upon past experiences and knowledge to on what "random" is,
                ultimately determining what your "random" action will be.
                <delay>8</delay>
                Anyways, if one was truly acting randomly, that doesn't seem
                like what we mean by acting with "free will".

                Naw, destiny and fate imply that no matter what you do,
                something is "destined" to happen.

                I think the opposite: your actions affect the future.

                Your actions combined with everything else *lead* to what

                If you sit in a ditch, then you will be in a ditch! Unless
                something takes you out. If you take steps to get out of the
                ditch, you may have to deal with a lot, but you probably won't
                be in a ditch. It's not destiny or fate; it's cause and effect.

                Free will as I have defined cannot exist. For everything that
                happens, there must be at least one cause. Don't get me started
                on what happened at the very beginning...

                Me too! That's fine and good. We make decisions based on what
                what we think and want... consciously or not.

                Look, you should keep making decisions based on what you believe
                and what you want to do. Whether or not there is free will
                doesn't change that.

                Perhaps this helps us understand and empathize others when they
                do what they do, and have more humility in one's own
                accomplishments.

                If someone else lived your life, had your body, your upbringing

                Now think of someone that you despise; perhaps a thief or a mass
