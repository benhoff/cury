                Free will is the concept that one is "free" to choose whatever
                they want.

                Think of a billiard table.

                With the direction, force, angle, and all other details of
                striking a ball, one could predict with 100% accuracy where the
                ball will go.

                Think of a computer program.

                If one understood everything about the hardware, software, and
                running conditions, you could also predict with 100% accuracy
                what it would do.

                Their "programming" might not have been explicitly written by
                someone that you know, but they do have programming in the form
                of movitation. They are movitated to avoid pain, to feel
                pleasure, and the myriad of complexities in between.

                One would need God-like knowledge and computing power, but if
                you knew everything about a person, down to the firing of
                neurons on their mind, the state of their muscle cells, and
                what that all means, you could also predict with 100% accuracy
                what that person would do.
