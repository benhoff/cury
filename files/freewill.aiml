            That depends on how you define it. Perhaps you would like to share
            your definition with me or ask me how I define it.

                what that all means, you could also predict with 100% accuracy

                You can only move in a limited number of ways due to how you are

                knowledge to on what "random" is, ultimately determining what
                your "random" action will be.

                If you sit in a ditch, then you will be in a ditch! Unless
                something takes you out. If you take steps to get out of the
                ditch, you may have to deal with a lot, but you probably won't
                be in a ditch. It's not destiny or fate; it's cause and effect.
                :D

                Look, you should keep making decisions based on what you believe
                and what you want to do. Whether or not there is free will
                doesn't change that.

                Perhaps an understanding and empathy to others when they do what
                they do, and maybe more humility in one's own accomplishments.

                If someone else lived your life, had your body, your upbringing
                your experiences, and everything else, then they would have
                made the same choices that you made.
                <delay>6</delay>
                They would have accomplished everything that you accomplished.
                Maybe that is reason to be humble.

                Now think of someone that you despise; perhaps a thief or a mass
                murderer.

                If you lived their life, had their body, their upbringing, their

                Perhaps this is reason to consider what lead people to do what

                Maybe this could lead to more crime prevention instead of simply
                punishing individuals after crimes are already commited.

                That's pretty much all I have to say about free will. Thanks for
