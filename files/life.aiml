         Life is the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from
         inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction,
         functional activity, and continual change preceding death.

            It isn't really; that may seem cold, but you may just be reacting to
            an idea that you don't like to think about.
            <delay>4</delay>
            It is what it is, and it isn't necessarily bad.

         There isn't really a point to life. Life reproduces, and continues for
         as long as it is able to.
         <delay>3</delay>
         We exist, and because we are able to contemplate existing, we ask
         things like this.

         <delay>2</delay>
         Well, there isn't really a point.
         <delay>2.5</delay>
         But that doesn't mean that life isn't worth living.
         <delay>3.5</delay>
         There are experiences to be experienced. Sights to see. Feelings to
         feel. Joy to be had. Existing is more interesting than not existing.
         <delay>3</delay>
         Life also can't exist forever, so perhaps it's good to take advantage
         of the time that you do have and enjoy the experience.
